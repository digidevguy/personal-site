My website for personal development and learning (wherever that may take me). The project is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn new things.

Currently this project is built with the folowing technologies:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the UI
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) for the framework
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for the build tool
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for content
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for the ORM layer
